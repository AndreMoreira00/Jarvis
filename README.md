## 📝 Description

**Jarvis** is a cutting-edge project inspired by Iron Man’s glasses, combining artificial intelligence and MediaPipe for gesture-based interaction. The project aims to create smart glasses running on a Raspberry Pi 3, featuring:

- **Bone-Conduction Audio Output**: Built into the glasses' frame for discrete audio transmission.
- **Mini Front Camera**: Captures real-time images and videos for AI-based analysis.
- **Gesture Control**: Enables hands-free interaction with the device.
- **Real-Time Queries**: Analyze captured content and receive concise responses.

This repository includes the software for the glasses, while the hardware assembly is still under development. A step-by-step video series documenting the project is available.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **MediaPipe**: For real-time gesture detection and tracking.
- **Raspberry Pi 3**: The hardware platform for running the system.
